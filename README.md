# Hawaii_Tour_Guide_Project
Our project is focused on creating a webpage that is a tourist guide for visiting Honolulu, Hawaii. We want to give users who visit our webpage the option to navigate the settings, stays, and attractions that Hawaii offers: hotels, restaurants, attractions (surfing spots, native Hawaii events, golf, water attractions), and weather.

We are going to use the Data Visualization Track which will consist of a webpage that consists of 4-5 different visualizations of the attractions that Hawaii has to offer (mentioned above: hotel, restaurants, attractions…). These visualizations will have a few parameters that include price and rating. Other additional parameters like hours of operation may be added. 

We’ll be using a combination of Python and Javascript to write our scripts and create notebooks. Additionally, MongoDB will be our database that will allow us to collect data for some of the static visualizations that we create. Dynamic API calls for interactive visualizations will come from a few of the following APIs.
